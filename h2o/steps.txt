# use source packages for both packages numpy and then scipy

# packages both depend on many dependecies
# ensure all are install first
# wget the source package
# extract the package and install the files
# ensure all dependecies are installed in the virtualenv?
# then run the package and install it from an egg file?
# create egg files with the required dependencies inside?
