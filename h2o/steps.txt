# use source packages for both packages numpy and then scipy

# packages both depend on many dependecies
# ensure all are install first
# wget the source package
# extract the package and install the files
# ensure all dependecies are installed in the virtualenv?
# then run the package and install it from an egg file?
# create egg files with the required dependencies inside?

# www.scipy.org/scipylib/building/linux.html
#
# install the depends sudo apt-get install gcc gfortran python-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev cython
#
# do python setup.py build on the file 
# 
# then do a python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/local   --- path to dir where to install usually like virtualenv 
# 
# make an egg file from the stuff created?
